title: "Launching My Personal Website"

I decided to make this website to shocase some of my projects, and things that I have worked on or thought about. It is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), which conveniently is already built into github hosting. I've decided to keep the website static for now, because for some reason I've always appreciated the simplicity of non JS heavy websites in a world of Angular, React, and the like. Who knows though, my opinion on this will likely change.
