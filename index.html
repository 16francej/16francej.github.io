	<p>Hello! I'm Joshua France, currently studying Computer Science and Electrical/Computer Engineering at Duke. Before that I lived in Tokyo and went to American School in Japan. This is my blog/portfolio, with a peek into some of the projects and problems Iâ€™ve been working on or thinking about. </p>
